    <h2>
        HI, my name is
        AMINAT
    </h2>

<p>And Jewel food Blog is my little corner of the internet! <br>

I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Jewel food blog. <br>
What started as a casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth grade <br>
 teacher has now grown into a full-blown business <br>
that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, <br>
with content that has been featured on The Kitchen. <br>
I live in Aberdeen, with my husband Crown and our daughter princess <br>
 My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the musuem park <br>
</p>




<h2>I Love Food!</h2>
<p>In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, <br>
    (mostly) healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual, every day life. <br>
    If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put in on the blog. <br>
    My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable AND exciting, <br>
    whether you’re cooking for yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. <br>
    I want you to be so excited about these recipes that you eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from work and start cooking.</p><br>
